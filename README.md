# EV Charging Station Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Infrastructure across North America. The dashboard provides insights into the growth of charging stations, station usage, geographic distribution, and proximity to highways, helping users understand key patterns and trends in EV charging infrastructure.

## Overview

Electric vehicles are becoming more popular, increasing the demand for reliable charging stations. This project visualizes various metrics related to EV charging stations, such as:

- Number of charging stations over time
- Distribution of public vs. private charging stations
- Charging station usage based on distance to highways
- Geographic distribution of stations across North America

The dashboard can be used by stakeholders, urban planners, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions on expanding and improving EV charging infrastructure.

## Dashboard Features

The **Power BI Dashboard** provides the following visualizations:

1. **Total Charging Stations and Average Annual Usage by Year**:
   - Shows the growth trend of the number of charging stations and their average usage over time.
   
2. **Count of StationID by StationType**:
   - A pie chart depicting the breakdown of public vs. private stations.

3. **Count of Stations by City**:
   - A bar chart showing the number of charging stations in key cities across North America.

4. **Sum of Annual Usage (kWh) by Distance to Highway (miles)**:
   - A line graph that shows how annual station usage varies depending on proximity to highways.

5. **Geographical Map of Charging Stations**:
   - An interactive map highlighting charging station locations by state/province and station I

## Key Insights

- **Steady Growth**: The number of charging stations has consistently increased over time, aligning with the growing adoption of electric vehicles.
- **Public Dominance**: Most charging stations are publicly accessible, making EV infrastructure more widely available.
- **Highway Proximity**: Stations located closer to highways tend to have higher usage, suggesting the importance of location for station efficiency.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Calgary have the most stations, while some rural areas may require further development.
